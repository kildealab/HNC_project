## Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning

* Through this code the data collected was:<br>
  *  Cleaned<br>
  *  Analysed<br>
  *  Preprocessed<br>
  *  Used for machine learning<br>

* To run these scripts you should have access to [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e7VH-aApdMa6oUCCbxbKbKHUNHiO8RR_?usp=sharing) folder.

### [Data Combing and Visualization](https://github.com/Srishti013/HNC_project/blob/Srishti/Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning/data_combing_and_visualization.py)

* The present datasets were concatenated into a single data file using this script.
* This script can further be used to add more data sets into the [master dataset](https://github.com/Srishti013/HNC_project/blob/Srishti/Datafiles/master.csv).
* After that the data was visualized using histograms and heatmap

### [Classification](https://github.com/Srishti013/HNC_project/blob/Srishti/Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning/data_cleaning%2C_preparation_and_classification.py)

* Through this script the data was preprocessed in order to get it into classification model
* Later 15 classification models were used to predict whether the patient would require replanning or not based on the data of first 12 fractions of the patient.
* The best accuracy score was 0.778 by extra trees classifier.

### [Regression](https://github.com/Srishti013/HNC_project/blob/Srishti/Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning/regression.py)
* This script involves preprocessing the data for regression model
* Here I used 3 regression models but the results were not good because right now we only have data of 31 replanned patients which do not have any strong trend.
* But this script can be used when we have more data or stronger influential factors.
