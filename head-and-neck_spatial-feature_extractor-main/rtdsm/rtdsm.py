def interpolate_missed_points(samppoints,failvects,centroid):
    """
    Fills in points missed by ray casting in the sample_uniangular method by
    interpolating along a spline loop created from successfully found points.
    Used as an optional subfunction within sample_uniangular.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samppoints : numpy.ndarray
        Array of point coordinates from equiangular ray casting. Failed points 
        given as np.nan.
    failvects : numpy.ndarray      
        Array of ray casting vectors that failed to detect a point on the ROI 
        mesh.
    centroid :  numpy.ndarray       
        Coordinate where ray casting originated from.

    Returns
    -------
    samppoints : numpy.ndarray     
        Updated array of point coordinates with failed points filled with 
        interpolated fix.

    Notes
    -------
    Because this method depends on successfully ray-casted points to perform the 
    fix, accuracy decreases the more points that failed. This method should only 
    be needed to be called for a small number of points (1-4) on one or two slices 
    total. If it is called more frequently it is recommended to check the ROI mesh 
    quality, as it tends to be an indicator of a holey or otherwise poorer 
    quality mesh.
